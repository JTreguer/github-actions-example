# Github Actions

What is GitHub Actions?
* GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform built right into GitHub.
* It lets you automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying your code directly from your repository.
* You can define custom workflows, or pipelines, that are triggered by specific events, such as pushing code, creating a pull request, or scheduling a run.
